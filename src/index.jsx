        <p>I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. I have a passion for tech, and I also have a passion for making stuff: I've dabbled in game design, web-dev, and low-level programming.

        <p>Before I made things with code, I made things with paper. I've put a few of them on my website for your viewing pleasure.</p>
